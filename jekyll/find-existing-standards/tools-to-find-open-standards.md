# [Civic open data standards](https://azavea.gitbooks.io/open-data-standards/content/)

This guide from [Azavea](http://www.azavea.com/), a geospatial technology company, focuses on open standards for the civic domain. 

It describes standards that are already in use in cities and potential future standards. The focus is on standards that use location, have good documentation, are machine-readable (so the standards can be used by software), and have been adopted by at least one city or [civic technology](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/09/19/what-is-civic-technology/#1025cfc3ecc) organisation.
