description: A variety of organisations currently support the development and adoption of open standards for data. This section profiles some of those organisations and how they can support you.

[360Giving](http://www.threesixtygiving.org/) was founded in 2015 by a group of like-minded funders and open data experts who wanted to open up the grantmaking sector and make it easier to find out who is funding what, where and how much. 

360Giving supports organisations to publish their grants data in an open, standardised way and helps people to understand and use the data in order to support decision-making and learning across the charitable giving sector.

# Do you have a focus on a specific type of standard or sector?

The organisation primarily focuses on UK grantmakers, but any organisation that makes grants can use the 360Giving Standard, including charitable trusts and foundations, governments and local authorities. 

# What standards have you helped to develop or support?

The 360Giving Standard: [http://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/latest/](http://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/latest/) 

# What type of support can you offer to organisations interested in developing open standards for data?

We are available to discuss the schema for the 360Giving Standard, what we have learned when designing it and how people interpret and use the Standard and the accompanying documentation.
