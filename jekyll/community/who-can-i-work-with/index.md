description: A variety of organisations currently support the development and adoption of open standards for data. This section profiles some of those organisations and how they can support you.
---

There are many organisations working to develop open standards for data. Some are international or national standards bodies. Others are smaller organisations working within specific sectors.

These organisations can help you [find and adopt existing standards](/find-existing-standards/). They can also provide advice to help you to extend an existing standard to support new requirements.

If you have [identified the need for a new standard](/creating-open-standards/developing-standards/scoping-and-starting/) then an experienced organisation can help you by guiding its [development](/creating-open-standards/developing-standards/development/) and driving [adoption](/creating-open-standards/developing-standards/launch-and-adoption/).

Some organisations may also help to host your standards work by providing collaboration tools and an intellectual property framework. For example the W3C provides [community groups](/useful-tools/how-to-set-up-a-w3c-community-group/) to help organisations across different sectors to collaborate around standards.
