# Our community podcast

In this podcast we interview people from across the open standards community. We've asked them to share their thoughts on open standards for data. 

We explore a number of questions, including how standards are developed, how they create impact and how to drive adoption of a standard.

The podcast consists of highlights of more in-depth interviews with each of the contributors. You can find links to the other podcasts on this page. Or [use our SoundCloud playlist](https://soundcloud.com/theodi/sets/standards-community-voices) to listen to them all.

# Adding your voice

We'd like to encourage other members of the standards community to share their thoughts and experiences. 

If you'd like to contribute to the "Community Voices" series then you can record a short 10-15 minute podcast with yourself or a colleague. If you post the podcast to [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) under an open licence and [send us a link](mailto:standards@theodi.org) then we can add it to our playlist and the guidebook.

While we can't help you record or edit the podcast, we do have some tips for what you might include.

After introducing yourself and the organisation you work with, consider answering some of the following questions:

1. How have you been involved in the development or adoption of open standards for data?
2. What are the key things you've learned when developing standards?
3. What do you think makes for a successful, well-adopted standard?
4. What advice or insight would you give someone involved in developing open standards for data?
