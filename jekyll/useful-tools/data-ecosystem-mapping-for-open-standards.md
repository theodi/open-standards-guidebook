Ecosystem maps help you to visualise, understand and communicate how data is published, accessed, shared, and used by different people and organisations. Mapping a data ecosystem can help you to identify where adopting or creating open standards for data could add value.

# What is data ecosystem mapping?

Data ecosystem maps are a way to visualise, understand and communicate how organisations and creating and exchanging data.

Creating a map of a data ecosystem can help us to understand and explain how and where the use of data creates value. Ecosystem maps help to identify the stakeholders involved in creating value from data and their relationships. 

# The benefits of mapping data ecosystems

There are benefits to be gained not only from creating a map of a data ecosystem, but also from the process of drawing it. 

Mapping requires you to consider the different actors, relationships and ideas in the ecosystem, and can generate useful insights and talking points. As a collaborative process it can build understanding of a data ecosystem across different stakeholders. The end product is useful as a communication tool to support engagement across the data ecosystem. 

Creating maps of existing data ecosystems can help to:

* __develop shared understanding__ of the variety of ways in which participants add and create value
* __clarify roles and responsibilities__ to help improve an ecosystem and the adoption of best practices
* __support engagement__, e.g. by identifying key stakeholders

# Mapping data ecosystems when developing standards

[Scoping a new standard](/creating-open-standards/developing-standards/scoping-and-starting/) requires developing an understanding of how and where introducing a standard might add value. Driving [adoption](/creating-open-standards/developing-standards/launch-and-adoption/) of an existing standard requires engaging with and supporting potential users.

Drawing a map of a data ecosystem can help with both of these processes. Specifically, a map can help to:

* __identify where a standards can add value__
* __bring clarity to the scope of the standard__, by focusing on the supported data flows
* __identify stakeholders__ to involve in the process of developing the standard
* __support engagement__ by identifying the key stakeholders to engage with launching your standard

By mapping the ecosystem you can establish where your open standard fits and the value it can provide. By providing value to stakeholders, your open standard is more likely to be adopted and create impact.
