        title: Peer Networks
        description: >-
          [Peer networks](https://theodi.org/topic/peer-networks/) are a popular way of [developing leadership and sharing knowledge](https://theodi.org/article/peer-networks-for-open-data-leaders/) across communities.
          <br/><br/>
          In the process of developing this guidebook we were able to bring together a diverse set of people working with open standards for data. The insight generated 
          from those discussions demonstrated the value of encouraging more peer networking across that community.
          <br/><br/>      
          In this section of the site we showcase some of the organisations and individuals developing or supporting open standards for data.
