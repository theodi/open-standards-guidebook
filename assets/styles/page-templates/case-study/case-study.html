                <p>What if it was as easy to find public transport information as it is to get driving directions?</p>

                <p>This question is at the heart of GTFS, the standard for transit data. Every time you use CityMapper, Google Maps or even ride sharing apps like Park.io, you’re relying on GTFS.</p>

                <h3>About GTFS and GTFS-RT</h3>

                <p>What if it was as easy to find public transport information as it is to get driving directions? This question is at the heart of GTFS, the standard for transit data. Every time you use CityMapper, Google Maps or even ride sharing apps like Park.io, you’re relying on GTFS.</p>

                <p>General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and General Transit Feed Specification Real-Time (GTFS-RT) extension are open and common formats for sharing public transport information: transit schedules with associated geographic information (GTFS) and real time transit updates (GTFS-RT). GTFS-RT is an extension of GTFS, it isn’t possible to share real time updates without a transit feed. </p>

                <h3>Data Overview</h3>

                <p>GTFS supports sharing agency transit data including: the agency, routing (stops, routes trips and maps), scheduling (schedules, stopping times, dates), and other supporting data.</p>

                <p>The feed files contain information about the feed, for example the publisher (where it’s different from the agency) and other useful information for data users, such as when the feed expires. The attributes reflect a simplified feed specification. Transit schedules are built using a calendar, the stop times with start and end times and optional information to handle irregular scheduling. The specification is based on a relational data model shown in the GTFS feed diagram, reference and examples.</p>

                <p>GTFS-RT supplements GTFS with trip updates (when something’s changed), service alerts (about things that affect stops and the network), or vehicle position (including updates on congestion). Agencies can provide one or more updates also known as field entities. GTFS-RT supports updating stop or end times and sharing uncertain or approximate delays.</p>
