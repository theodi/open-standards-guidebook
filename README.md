## Technologies / dependencies

### Built with

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) - static site generator
- [Blendid](https://github.com/vigetlabs/blendid) - Gulp + webpack build process
- [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) Living styleguide
- [Theo](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/theo) for handling [Design tokens](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/theo#overview)
- [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as a branching methodology

### Front end:

- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for stylesheets (compiled with node-sass)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for JS transpilation
- [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) for live reloading

### Linting

- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/)
- [sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint)

Linting is enforced on a pre-push hook via [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky). This can be disabled / modified via `.huskyrc`

### Deployment

- Deployed with [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/)
- Hosted on [GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## Prerequisties:

- [NodeJS runtime](https://nodejs.org/en/) - ~8.9.3 LTS release:
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-tab)
- [Ruby 2.5.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) or greater
- [bundler](https://bundler.io/)
- [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) extensions (only required for release)

## Project setup

```
git clone git@github.com:theodi/open-standards-guidebook.git
cd open-standards-guidebook
yarn install
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
cd contributions && bundle install --path vendor/bundle # install the deps for the the contributions form app
cd ..
```


## Commands

All commands are via node package scripts.


### Run dev server

```
yarn start
```

This command does several things concurrently:

- Starts jekyll server with `JEKYLL_ENV=development bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config.dev.yml` on `localhost:4000`
- Starts a browsersync proxy of the same server, typically on `localhost:3000` (actual port will be shown when starting the command). This is used to live inject the styles (via browsersync) and JS (via webpack hot reload)
- Starts the Fractal styleguide server (typically on http://localhost:4001/, see command output for your case)
- Starts [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) to run the contributions Sinatra application

It will also open the Fractal styleguide and browsersync proxied Jekyll build in your default web browser. Additional Browsersync UI tools available on port 3001.


### Building for production

```
yarn build
```

This builds the assets via blendid and then runs `JEKYLL_ENV='production' bundle exec jekyll build`

Compiles files for production to your destination directory. JS files are built with webpack 3 with standard production optimizations (uglfiy, etc.). CSS is run through CSSNano.

If `rev` is set to `true` in your `task-config.js` file, filenames will be hashed (file.css -> file-a8908d9io20.css) so your server may cache them indefinitely. A `rev-manifest.json` file is output to the root of your `dest` directory (`public` by default), and maps original filenames to hashed ones. Static files are automatically updated to reference the hashed filenames. A custom Jekyl plugin (rev) is used to to read the manifest file and replace references to static asset filenames via a liquid filter.


### Secondary tasks

### Linting

Linting (via `yarn lint`) is enforced on a pre-push hook via [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky). This can be disabled / modified via `.huskyrc`.

JS files are also linted at Babel compile time via `eslint-friendly-formatter`.

The following tasks are available for your manual linting requirements:


```
yarn lint-styles
yarn lint-js
yarn lint # all the things

```


#### Building styleguide as static HTML

```
yarn generate-styleguide
```

This builds the Fractal styleguide to static HTML and outputs it to a `component-library/` directory (gitignored) in the project root.


#### Check HTML links (WIP)

```
yarn html-proofer
```

This runs [html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) with options configured via a [rake task](./Rakefile).

This task is currently designed to be run locally (i.e. not in CI)

Because we're currently deploying the site to a subdirectory, it also requires some temporary changes to `_config.yml` or it will throw a large number of false positives:

Required:

- comment out the `url` and `baseurl` keys. This is required so that Jekyll writes out links in a way that html-proofer can resolve. This can probably be worked around using html-proofer's `url_swap` feature, but we have not currently got that working correctly.

Optional:

- Change `env` to `development` (not required but will disable html minification making the build _much_ faster)




## Release and deployment

A release script is included for convenience. Use a [semver](https://semver.org/) compliant version.

```
./scripts/release <SEMVER>
```

This will:

- Create a new release branch from `develop`
- Bump the `VERSION` file and commit it
- Merge back into `develop` and `master`
- Tag the release
- Push the release and tag to `origin/master`

**NB** Release script requires [`git-flow`](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) cli to be installed locally.

## Configuration

### Jekyll

See inline documentation in `_config.yml` / `_config.dev.yml` for details.

Additionally, We are using the following plugins, auto installed via the `:jekyll_plugins` group in `Gemfile`.

jekyll-git_metadata - Git metadata for last edited dates on oages
octopress-minify-html - Minifies HTML on build only
jekyll-sitemap - XML sitemap generator
jekyll-seo-tag - SEO metadata generation

### Blendid

You may override the default configuration via editing `path-config.json` and `task-config.js` in the `build/` directory. See the separate [`README.md`](blob/develop/build/README.md) and inline documentaton in that directory for full options available.

## Contributions application

The `contributions/` directory contains a small [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) application that takes form submissions and turns them into issues / PRs on the GitHub repo via the GH api. For full details of this component of the project see [`contributions/README.md`](blob/develop/contributions/README.md).

## Hacks

- The `jekyll-git_metadata` is monkey patched in `src/_plugins/git_metadata.rb` to handle the fact that we're running Jekyll in a subdirectory of the project

## Other useful bits

- Regenerate the table of content for this README.md (or any other) by running `./scripts/gh-md-toc README.md` and pasting in the output
